<h1 align="center">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in C++</h1>
<hr>

<p><b>This repository contains simple and clear examples of fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts implemented in C++. Below are the concepts covered along with brief explanations:</b></p>

<h2>Four Pillars of OOP's</h2>

<ol>
  <li><b>Encapsulation:</b></li>
  <p>Encapsulation is the bundling of data with methods that operate on that data. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components and prevents the accidental modification of data.</p>

  <li><b>Inheritance</b></li>
  <p>Inheritance allows one class (derived class) to inherit the properties and behaviors of another class (base class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.</p>

  <li><b>Polymorphism:</b></li>
  <p>Polymorphism allows methods to do different things based on the object they are acting upon. It provides a way to perform a single action in different ways.</p>

  <li><b>Abstraction:</b></li>
  <p>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex reality while exposing only necessary parts. It helps in reducing programming complexity and effort.</p>
  
</ol>

<h2>Other OOP's Concept</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Member Functions:</b></li>
  <p>Member functions are functions associated with an object and have access to its data. They operate on the object's data and can be called using object instances.</p>

  <li><b>Function Overloading:</b></b></li>
  <p>Function overloading in C++ allows you to define multiple functions with the same name but with different parameters. The compiler determines which function to call based on the number or type of arguments passed.</p>

  <li><b>Function Overriding:</b></li>
  <p>Function overriding occurs in the context of inheritance. When a derived class provides a specific implementation for a function that is already declared in its base class, it is known as function overriding. The function in the derived class "overrides" the function in the base class.</p>
</ul>
